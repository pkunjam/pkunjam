### About me

I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science and engineering from the International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur, India, in 2021. My research interests are primarily concerned with human-computer interaction (HCI) and focus on building novel immersive systems for the augmentation of brain function, improving peopleâ€™s lives. I am also interested in developing simulation-based surgical training systems leveraging robotics and mixed reality technologies to provide surgeons with low-cost solutions for practicing surgical procedures in a virtual environment. I have worked with premier research institutions for my internships, such as **Johns Hopkins University (JHU), MIT Media Lab, and the University of Canterbury**. My research from MIT Media Lab and JHU has been published at prestigious venues, namely, **ACM SIGGRAPH and Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering: Imaging and Visualization**, received a monetary prize and outstanding paper award.

Besides research, I like to travel. During work breaks, I enjoy trekking, exploring different places, and learning about different cultures across the globe. I play chess in my free time and have participated in national-level chess tournaments during my high school.

I aspire to become a research scientist and see myself working in a leading R&D organization in the future.
