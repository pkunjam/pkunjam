### About me

I am a Computer Science graduate student specializing in game development, AR/VR/MR, graphics, and haptics. I have a proven track record of research and development in haptic interaction and human-computer interfaces. Pursuing a Master of Mathematics in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo has equipped me with a deep understanding of technology and its application in creating immersive user experiences.

I have a unique blend of technical skills, creative problem-solving abilities, and a strong foundation in programming languages such as C#, C++, and JavaScript. I have hands-on expertise in Unity3D, CHAI3D, OpenGL, and similar game/graphics engines and frameworks, and I have contributed to innovative projects that bridge the gap between technology and practical utility. My work spans developing video games, immersive haptics & VR-based simulations, and AR-based educational tools, showcasing my ability to innovate and push the boundaries of current technology.

Apart from my technical skills, I am a committed team player and leader. I have led initiatives as a mentor and organized major events like gaming tournaments. My ability to communicate effectively, mentor peers, and successfully lead projects has been recognized in various professional settings.

I am passionate about the potential of AR/VR/MR and haptic technologies to revolutionize how we interact with digital interfaces. I aim to create more intuitive, immersive, and beneficial user experiences. My ambition is to continue leveraging my skills in a challenging environment that fosters growth, innovation, and the opportunity to make significant contributions to the technology field.

My goal is to be at the forefront of technological advancement, contributing my expertise to projects that have a lasting impact.
