### About me

I am a Computer Science graduate with a Master of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo, specializing in XR (AR/VR/MR), computer graphics, game development, and haptics. I am passionate about leveraging AI to revolutionize XR technologies, creating transformative and immersive user experiences.

My unique blend of technical expertise, creative problem-solving, and experience with AI-driven XR solutions sets me apart. With a solid foundation in C#, C++, and JavaScript, I’ve developed and optimized immersive AR/VR simulations, haptics-based interaction systems, and game engines using tools such as Unity3D, OpenGL, and CHAI3D. These projects demonstrate my ability to push the boundaries of XR, integrating AI to make digital environments more interactive, personalized, and intelligent.

In addition to my technical skills, I bring a strong collaborative spirit and leadership capabilities. I’ve led initiatives as a mentor, driven key projects in research settings, and organized major events. My focus is on bridging XR technologies with AI, allowing for more intuitive, adaptive, and accessible digital interfaces that can revolutionize industries from education to healthcare.

My goal is to leverage AI and XR to redefine human-computer interaction, bringing forth solutions that have the potential to reshape how we experience the digital world. I will continue innovating in this space, contributing to projects that not only challenge current limitations but also have a lasting impact on the future of immersive technology.
