### About

I am a Computer Science Undergraduate and I am passionate about developing and evaluating new technologies using VR/AR. My career aspiration is to become an independent scientist. My research interest lies in the area of Human-Computer Interaction, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Robotics. <br>

My motivation for pursuing research related to VR stems from learning about the challenges of HCI during the summer in 2019, spent as an intern in Mimyk Medical Simulation, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. I am particularly interested in studying problems with practical impact, and I enjoy the process of exploring applications in different problem domains. I always seek the ability to connect real-world applications with theoretical models which is crucial to successful research.
