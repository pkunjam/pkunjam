### About

I am a computer science undergraduate and I am passionate about developing and evaluating new technologies using VR/AR. My career aspiration is to become an independent scientist. My research interest lies in the area of Human-Computer Interaction, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Computer Graphics, and Robotics.

I have worked with renowned organizations for my internships such as Johns Hopkins University, MIT Media Lab, and University of Canterbury.

In the near future I am interested to do a PhD in the field of HCI or Robotics.
