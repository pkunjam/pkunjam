### About me

Hello! I'm Punit Kunjam, currently a graduate student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing a Master of Mathematics in Computer Science with a fully funded scholarship. I anticipate graduating in August 2024 and am actively involved in research at the Haptic Experience Lab, affiliated with the Games Institute at the University of Waterloo. Under the guidance of Prof. Oliver Schneider, my work focuses on advancing the field of human-computer interaction (HCI).

I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from the International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur, India, in 2021. Throughout my academic journey, my research interests have centred around HCI, particularly in creating innovative immersive systems to enhance the lives of individuals with disabilities. Additionally, I'm passionate about developing simulation-based surgical training systems, leveraging robotics and mixed-reality technologies. These systems aim to provide cost-effective solutions for surgeons to practice procedures in a virtual environment.

My prior research experiences include collaborations with esteemed institutions such as Johns Hopkins University (JHU), MIT Media Lab, and the University of Canterbury. Notably, my work from MIT Media Lab and JHU has been published in prestigious venues like ACM SIGGRAPH and Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering: Imaging and Visualization. I've received both a monetary prize and an outstanding paper award for my contributions.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a keen interest in travel. During breaks, I indulge in trekking, exploring new places, and immersing myself in diverse cultures worldwide. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess and have participated in national-level tournaments during high school.

Looking ahead, I aspire to become a research scientist and envision myself contributing to cutting-edge developments in leading research and development organizations.
